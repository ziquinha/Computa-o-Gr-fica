## TP 1 Notes

- Relatively straight forward, introductary exercise, no real problems in executing it
- In exercise 2, item 2, we got a better understanding of the function of the Interface class and how to work with it
- In exercise 2, item 3, we learned how to create double-sided objects and therefore got a better grasp of the rules associated with writing the indices array
